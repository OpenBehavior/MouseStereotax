# MouseStereotax
3D printed mouse stereotax

Designed by Lex Kravitz (lex.kravitz@gmail.com)

This is a design of a 3D printed mouse stereotax with a gas mask for iso delivery.  We've used this in anesthetized recordings.  Although it does not include manipulator arms so it is not suitable for brain injections without adding those somehow.

Editable TinkerCAD files are here: https://www.tinkercad.com/things/gO1cjzznjMV  This was also "remixed" here, which has some improvements to my design: https://optogeneticsandneuralengineeringcore.gitlab.io/ONECoreSite/projects/AnestesiaSurgerySystem/
